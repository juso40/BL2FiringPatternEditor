## Requirement
    - Python 3.x
    - pip install pygame
    
## Installation/ Usage
Simply clone/download this repository and run the ``main.py`` file.   
To run the `main.py` you most likely can double click the file if you are on windows and have python installed.  
Else you might have to use ``cmd`` and ``cd`` into the ``main.py``'s  directory and start it by running ``python main.py``.  
The `BL2FiringPatternBG.png` is simply the background rendered by pygame, its used to give you a sense of scale about your FiringPattern.  
You can take any other picture with the same name and replace it with this file if you desire so.
The FiringPatterns won't be 1:1 as i this application, in game the pattern will be a bit smaller.
